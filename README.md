# jira-info

Use `.jira-inforc` in the current working directory to store configs you don't want to keep repeating.  You can store your password, but that's probably not a good idea.  You will be prompted for anything missing from the file as needed.

```js
{
  "username": "some.dude",
  "password": "correcthorsebatterystaple",
  "jira-url": "https://jira.prometheanjira.com"
}
```
